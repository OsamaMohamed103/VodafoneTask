Using Selenium/Java Tool , maven and different framkeworks like testng and cucmber i have built my code to test Vodafone EShop
And i have used different design patterns like "POM" in writing my code 
And in my interview Eng-Ibrahim mentioned that i need to use xpath locator so i have used xpath locator as much as i can.It's More Accurate
I have used different selenium commands to earn your trust
and finally in runner class is to ""create report after test"".


in RestAssured Package it's related to API section
i have used it's dependency to test API and hamcrest matchers and testng dependency for the response assertion 
and i assert on response body and status code 

and in manual testing i have used excel to wirte my testcases and bug report in details i tried to avoid open source testing tool
i can use it but i wanted to write it in details.

and finally you will find recoreded video for the run hope you watch it.

and i hope you find it useful.
Thanks.
